# Basic Compiler
This repository contains code from my "Languages & Compilers" module from 3rd year of University.

## Concept

* Design the Syntax of a primitive programming language.
* Language should include basic Arithmetic and Boolean expressions
* Design a compiler using ANTLR to 'compile' code written in this language to Python.

## Specification

### Technical Requirements

* Java 11
* Some Java IDE - either Eclipse or Intellij
* Python 3.x (to test compiled scripts work correctly)

### Required Libraries

* ANTLR (4.7.2)

## Documentation
The 'documentation' pdf contains a break-down of how my custom language is structured as well as some basic information 
how the compiler works.
