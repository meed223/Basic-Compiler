# Basic Compiler
This repository contains code from my "Languages & Compilers" module from 3rd year of University.

The task was to create a basic programming language and compiler written in Java, using the ANTLR library.

This repo won't recieve regular updates, it is mainly to keep this code in a convenient place to access as well as
to use as demonstration of past coding work.

## Requirements & Setup
To use this code, you will need to download the ANTLR 4.7.2 Jar file.
Any recent version of Java should also be used.

## Documentation
The 'documentation' pdf contains a break-down of how my custom language is structured as well as some basic information 
how the compiler works.
